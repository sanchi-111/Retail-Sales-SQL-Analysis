-- Author: [Sanchi Gupta]
-- Tools: PostgreSQL, pgAdmin 4
-- Objective: Data cleaning, logical auditing, and business analysis
-- =============================================

-- 1. DATABASE SETUP
-- Creating the table schema

CREATE TABLE retail_sales (
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,
    gender VARCHAR(15),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(15),
    quantiy INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);

----Verification: Ensuring data loaded correctly
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
LIMIT 10;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;


-- 2. DATA CLEANING & SCRUBBING

-- Step A: Identify nulls

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    transactions_id IS NULL OR sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR 
    customer_id IS NULL OR gender IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantiy IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL OR total_sale IS NULL;

-- Step B:Remove Nulls 

    DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    transaction_id IS NULL
    OR
    sale_date IS NULL
    OR 
    sale_time IS NULL
    OR
    gender IS NULL
    OR
    category IS NULL
    OR
    quantity IS NULL
    OR
    cogs IS NULL
    OR
    total_sale IS NULL;


---3. DATA INTEGRITY (If any transaction has a 'price' of 0 or a 'quantity' that is negative.)
-- -- A. Profit Margin Check: Finding negative margins

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
where price_per_unit = 0 
OR quantity <0

---B.Checking for profitability errors

SELECT 
 transactions_id,cogs,price_per_unit,
 (price_per_unit - cogs) as profit_margin
 from retail_sales 
 where cogs > price_per_unit 
 

-- B. Calculation Reconciliation: Verifying (Qty * Price = Total)

select 
from retail_sales
where  (quantity*price_per_unit) <> total_sale

-- 4. BUSINESS ANALYSIS & FINDINGS


-- Q.1 Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05

SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';


-- Q.2 Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022

SELECT 
  *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    category = 'Clothing'
    AND 
    TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
    AND
    quantity >= 4


-- Q.3 Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.

SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) as net_sale,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1

-- Q.4 Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.

SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(age), 2) as avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty'


-- Q.5 Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000


-- Q.6 Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) 
--made by each gender in each category.

SELECT 
    category,
    gender,
    COUNT(*) as total_trans
FROM retail_sales
GROUP 
    BY 
    category,
    gender
ORDER BY 1


-- Q.7 Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year

SELECT 
       year,
       month,
    avg_sale
FROM 
(    
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) as year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) as month,
    AVG(total_sale) as avg_sale,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) as rank
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1, 2
) as t1
WHERE rank = 1
    
-- ORDER BY 1, 3 DESC

-- Q.8 Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales 

SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_sale) as total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5

-- Q.9 Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.


SELECT 
    category,    
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as cnt_unique_cs
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category



-- Q.10 Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)
WITH hourly_sale
AS
(
SELECT *,
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END as shift
FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT 
    shift,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders    
FROM hourly_sale
GROUP BY shift
